Unity Project for the project vollAIball.
The backend is [here](https://github.com/gianfrancodemarco/vollAIballKB).

This project explores the realm of applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to train autonomous agents at the game of volleyball. 
It consists of a Unity 3D environment, crafted on purpose, where agents are trained using the ML-Agents library and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. 
Another vital component of the project is the Prolog Knowledge Base, acting as a narrator that provides detailed insights into the gameâ€™s events.
These two main components are glued together by using a Python backend and rest APIs. 
This project allowed to explore the possibility of integrating different AI systems, using modern tech stacks and providing variegated features.
